# Medical Research and Innovation: where to look at?
**R project: Data Analysis and Visualization**

We explore where the best places for health research and innovation are, and how this relates to the rates of specific illnesses. “Where” is meant to be general and refers not only to specific locations, such as cities/states, but also specific diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and other characteristics. We then rank the 11 top cities for health research and innovation.

**The report is broken down into six sections:**
* Section I is the background Introduction;
* Section II describes and summarize the data sources;
* Section III discusses our high-level analysis and hypotheses based on the type of disease, time, and location;
* Section IV describes hypotheses and trends in health research and innovation for specific cities; 
* Section V describes our ranking methodology and our final rankings. 
* Section VI concludes the assignment.
